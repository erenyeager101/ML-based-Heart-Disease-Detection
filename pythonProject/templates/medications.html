        <p>Here are some commonly prescribed medications for heart disease:</p>
        <p><strong>ACE Inhibitors:</strong> Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are heart medications that widen, or dilate, your blood vessels. That increases the amount of blood your heart pumps and lowers blood pressure. They also raise blood flow, which helps to lower your heart’s workload.</p>
        <p><strong>Angiotension II Receptor Blockers (ARBs):</strong> Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are a type of drug your doctor may prescribe to help treat your heart disease. They lower certain chemicals that narrow your blood vessels, which allows blood to flow more easily through your body. ARBs also lower certain chemicals that cause salt and fluid to build up in your body.</p>
        <p><strong>Antiarrhythmics:</strong> When you have atrial fibrillation, the goal is to get your heart rate under control and try to bring your heart back to rhythm. In addition, your doctor will want to help you prevent blood clots that can lead to a stroke. For many people with AFib, medicine is the best treatment option.</p>
        <p><strong>Antiplatelet Drugs:</strong> Platelet drugs are a group of powerful medicines that prevent blood clots. When you are wounded, platelets arrive on the scene and group together to form a clot that stops the bleeding. This is a good thing when an injury involves a break in your skin.</p>
        <p><strong>Aspirin Therapy:</strong> The recommendations come from an independent panel of experts in disease prevention and evidence-based medicine called the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The group has revamped its 2016 guidelines on aspirin after reviewing newer studies. In 2021, it released a draft version of proposed changes and made them available for public comment. Now, the task force has published its final recommendations: People 40 to 59 years old who are at higher risk for heart disease or stroke and don’t have a history of either condition should talk to their doctor about whether they should start taking aspirin as preventive step.</p>
        <p><strong>Beta-Blocker Therapy:</strong> Beta-blockers are one of the most widely prescribed classes of drugs to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and are a mainstay treatment of congestive heart failure. Beta-blockers work by blocking the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) and slowing the heart's rate, thereby decreasing the heart’s demand for oxygen. Long-term use of beta-blockers helps manage chronic heart failure.</p>
        <p><strong>Calcium Channel Blocker Drugs:</strong> Calcium channel blockers are prescription medications that relax blood vessels and increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while also reducing the heart's workload.</p>
        <p><strong>Clot Buster Drugs:</strong> Clot buster drugs, also known as thrombolytic therapy, are a type of heart medication given in the hospital through an IV to break up blood clots. Heart attack and ischemic stroke are the two main conditions that clot busters are used for.</p>
        <p><strong>Nitrates:</strong> If you have angina -- chest pain that happens when the arteries to your heart are blocked or narrowed -- your doctor may prescribe medicines called nitrates. They relax your arteries so blood can flow more easily to your ticker. Your doctor may also suggest you use nitrates along with another blood pressure drug (hydralazine) to treat congestive heart failure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Beta-blockers: Reduce heart rate and blood pressure.</li>
            <li>ACE inhibitors: Dilate blood vessels and lower blood pressure.</li>
            <li>Statins: Lower cholesterol levels.</li>
            <li>Aspirin: Reduce the risk of blood clots.</li>
            <li>Nitrates: Relax blood vessels and reduce chest pain.</li>
        </ul>
